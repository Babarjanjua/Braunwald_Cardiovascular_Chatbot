# Braunwald_Cardiovascular_Chatbot
This repository contains the code for a cardiovascular medicine chatbot built using LangChain, HuggingFace, and Gradio. The chatbot is designed to answer questions related to cardiovascular medicine based on the text extracted from the "Braunwald Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine" PDF. 
It uses advanced NLP models and a vector database for document retrieval and similarity searches. The application leverages GPU acceleration to enhance performance during embeddings and model inference.
The project aims to assist medical professionals and students by providing contextually accurate responses to questions about cardiovascular medicine.
